# Play With Java 17

### In this project, I practised and discussed the new features from Java 11 to Java 17, the last LTS of Java, released on 13 September 2021.
### I published an article at [Medium](https://medium.com/@nowshadapu/java-17-a-new-lts-and-whats-new-from-last-lts-java-11-8b56aaaa2326) discussing the features.

Features:

1. Switch expression
2. Records
3. Text block
4. Sealed class
5. Pattern matching
6. Others
    1. Improved NullPointerException stack trace
    2. New methods in String class i.e, `indent(int n)`, `transform(java.util.function.Function function)`
    3. New method `mismatch()` in Files class
    4. Local interface and enum

The new features help us to write less code. Interestingly, at compile time, some of these advance syntax like - Text block, Pattern matching, change the classes to our basic old java
classes, which can be found at `/out` folder.
